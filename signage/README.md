A simplified version of the ngBoilerplate angular project template.

## Quick Start
bower install & npm install
Simply running grunt watch will do the following:
 - Build everything (concat, create js templates of html, etc) and place it into a "build" folder
 - Run all your tests
 - Watch your files for changes to do the above without any intervention
 - Launch express server to host your app at http://localhost:9000/index.html
 - Setup LiveReload so you immediately see changes in your browser (you still have to enable LiveReload on your browser)
